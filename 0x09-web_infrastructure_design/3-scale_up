# 🚀 Scale-Up Web Infrastructure for `www.foobar.com`
*A high-performance, fault-tolerant architecture with dedicated servers for web, app, and database layers.*

---

## 🎯 **Goal**
Handle increased traffic, eliminate single points of failure (SPOF), and optimize performance by:
- **Isolating components** (Web/App/DB servers).  
- **Load balancer redundancy** (Active-Active cluster).  
- **Independent scaling** per layer.
