Scenario
A user opens their browser and types:
www.foobar.com

The request goes to a single server (IP: 8.8.8.8) running:

Nginx (web server)

PHP (app server)

MySQL (database)

How It Works
DNS Lookup

The browser asks DNS: "What’s the IP of www.foobar.com?"

DNS replies: 8.8.8.8 (an A Record).

Request Reaches the Server

The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to 8.8.8.8.

Nginx (on port 80 or 443) receives the request.

Nginx Handles the Request

If it's a static file (HTML, CSS, JS), Nginx serves it directly.

If it's dynamic (e.g., PHP), Nginx forwards it to PHP-FPM (PHP processor).

PHP Processes the Request

Runs code (e.g., login, search).

If needed, it queries MySQL (database) to fetch/save data.

Response Sent Back to User

PHP generates HTML → Nginx sends it back → Browser displays the page.

Problems With This Setup
❌ Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

If the server crashes, the whole site goes down.

❌ Downtime During Updates

Restarting Nginx/PHP/MySQL means the site is temporarily unavailable.

❌ Can’t Handle High Traffic

Only one server = limited CPU/RAM. Too many users = slow or crash.

Simple Fixes (Next Steps)
✅ Add a Backup Server → Avoid SPOF.
✅ Use Cloud Services → Auto-scaling for traffic spikes.
✅ Add a Load Balancer → Distribute traffic across multiple servers.

This is a basic but functional setup. For bigger sites, you’d need improvements! 🚀
